// console.log("2">1);
// console.log("02">1);


console.log(null > 0);
console.log(null == 0);//equality check and comparison works differently
console.log(null >= 0);//in comparison null is turned to 0 that's why >= is correct over here!!
//for undefined all the results are false 


// === //it checks the value as well as the datatyoe
